O pardon me thou bledding piece of earth
That I am meed and gentle with these butchers
Thou art the ruin of the noblest man
Who ever lived in the tide of times

Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over they wounds now do I prophesy
Which like dumb mouths do open their ruby lips
and beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
